###### Whale volcalization classification through the "Weyl transform"
###### This task tries to separate blue whale and right whale vocalizations via weyl transform, which is essentially Wigner distribution in this case.  
###### By estimating the base frequency and chirp rate information, we can reconstruct the polynomial phase whale signals.
