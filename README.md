### Whale volcalization classification through the "Weyl transform"
##### This task tries to separate blue whale and right whale vocalizations via weyl transform, which is essentially Wigner distribution in this case.  By estimating the base frequency and chirp rate information, we can reconstruction the polynomial phase whale signals.
